# A Java Store

**Hello**, My goal with this project was to design a simple store where I could
apply important concepts necessary to any other project. 
Studying Inheritance, Interfaces, Unit and Integrated Tests, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Encapsulation is
better and many others is, as everything, better by doing.

## Actual state

I have added all the main functionalities, so it is possible to add items to your
warehouse and cart.

### To do

1. Create a Product class and transform the Item class in an interface. With the
project's purpose that's not strictly necessary, but it can be good as a learning
matter;
2. Import a list of items from an external API.
